# audi-tuning
I have a 2001 Audi B5 S4 as well as a 2000 Audi B5 A4 and I'm working on learning to tune ect...
I've noticed there are lots of different applications, many open source, to run and I figured having a central app to manage everything would be helpful.

I also figured I could use this to track future tunes that I generate.
